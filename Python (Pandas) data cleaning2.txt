1. Downloading libraries

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import requests



2.Conecting with API and downloading CSV file

url = "https://api.dataexampleshr.com/files/aug_test"

response = requests.get(url)
response.raise_for_status()

with open("aug_test.csv", "wb") as f:
    f.write(response.content)

df = pd.read_csv("aug_test.csv")


print(df.head())


3. Quick look at data

#Just a quick look at all the data, to find out what's going on

pd.set_option("display.max_rows", None)
pd.set_option("display.max_columns", None)
df



4. Going back to standard Python data frame view

#Now we can go back to standard view

pd.reset_option("max_columns")
pd.reset_option("max_rows")
df



5. Removing duplicates

# first thing we have to do is to remove duplicates
# There is a column with unique values ("enrolee_id"), so its safe to search for and remove duplicates

df=df.drop_duplicates()



6. Finding out how many nulls are in each column

#Next step is to find out how many nulls we have in each column
#It will be helpful with celaning data, later on

df.isnull().sum()



7.Removing "city" column

# Now we're going to remove "city" column. This column is unecesery for us.
# There are to many diffrent cities in ths column and we have no use of this column.
# We're also going to save our data frame when the column is removed

df=df.drop(columns="city")



8. Removing punctuation marks in "gender" column

# We have some unwanted punctuation marks in "gender" column, so we're going to get rid of those

df["gender"]=df["gender"].str.strip("._/")
df



9. Value change in "enrolled_univeristy" column

# In "enrolled_university" we have values "no_enrollment", we're going to change that to "No enrollment"

df["enrolled_university"]=df["enrolled_university"].str.replace('no_enrollment','No enrollment')
df



10. Chnaging nulls into "No answer"

# Now we're going to change nulls ("NaN") into "No answer"

df=df.fillna('')
df=df.replace('','No answer')
df



11. Replacing indexing with "enrollee_id" column

# Now we're going to do in this data cleaning is replace current indexing with "enrollee_id" column rows.

df=df.set_index('enrollee_id')



12. Sorting new indexing ascending

# Last thing, we're going to sort it ascending.

df=df.sort_index()
df



13. Saving cleaned data frame into .csv file

# And now, we're going to save cleaned data frame to .csv file
df.to_csv(r"C:\Users\Michalek\Desktop\Power BI + Python(Pandas) Project\cleaneddf.csv", index=False)
